# GoLang Projects

> A collection of my Golang nitbits.

## Getting started

* Clone the repo. Each folder does what it does. README for each not necessary, but when needed I'll see if I can write one :wink:

## Testing

* Run `go get ./...` to resolve dependencies.
* Run `go test ./...` to run tests for all folders.
* Run `go test` in the individual folder for individual tests.
